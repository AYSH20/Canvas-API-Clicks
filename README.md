# Canvas API Click Extractor

The <a href="https://www.canvaslms.com/?lead_source_description=instructure.com_" target="_blank">Canvas</a> learning management system provides administrators with access to aggregate level student analytics via their The <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/" target="_blank">API</a>. 
 
The <b>Canvas-API-Click-Extraction.ipynb</b> Jupyter Notebook provides the step-by-step scripts for obtaining students’ hourly click activities in a Canvas course, which can then be downloaded as .csv file.

I also provide some basic scripts for visualizing students’ hourly activity counts.
